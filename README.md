# http2https

Basically it is been used with tcpdump to help me to troubleshoot HTTPS API calls.

## How to use that

### Without proxy 

You can do something like: 
```bash
./http2https -url https://ifconfig.info

```
### With proxy 

You can do something like: 
```bash
./http2https -url https://ifconfig.info -proxy http://localhost:3128
```
